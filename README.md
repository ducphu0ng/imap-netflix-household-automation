Lets speed it up!

### Prerequisites

No complex setup, no hassle. With just **Docker Compose**, you‚Äôre ready to run this project anywhere‚Äîeven on a Raspberry Pi. That‚Äôs it, seriously!

Don't forget to enable IMAP in your email provider. For example, in Gmail, go to Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > IMAP Access, and enable it:

[Gmail Forwarding POP/IMAP Settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ducphu0ng/imap-netflix-household-automation.git
   ```
2. navigate to folder
   ```sh
   cd imap-netflix-household-automation
   ```
3. Copy **.env.dist** to **.env** and fill in all the environment variables. For examples, see the [Examples](#environment-examples) section
   ```sh
   cp .env.dist .env
   ```
4. starting IMAP Listener with docker compose. üí°**PRO TIP** use the -d flag to run the process in the background look up to [docker compose up reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) 
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```
That‚Äôs it! Docker will automatically install all the necessary dependencies and start the script.

If you used the -d (detach) option with docker compose up, you can view the script's output ‚Äî as shown in [üöÄ Usage](#-usage) ‚Äî by using the following command: [docker compose logs reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/logs/)
```sh
docker compose logs -f
```
